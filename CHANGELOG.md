# Change Log

All notable changes to the "handy-perl-snippets" extension will be documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## Initial release

- Added 5 snippets namely `Add strict and warning directives`, `Add dumper`, `Add a new subroutine`, `Add a new subroutine with params`, `Add new print Dumper statement`.

## 1.0.1

- Added Logo

## 1.1.0

- Made some design changes.
- Snippets concerned with adding directives will start with u.
- Snippets mnemonics are made based on the first letter of the keywords used. For example mnemonic for **Add a dumper print statement** is `pd` (p and d corresponds to print and Dumper respectively).
- If a snippets generates boilerplate for a keyword in perl (imagine a snippet for subroutine), mnemonic will be same as the keyword.
